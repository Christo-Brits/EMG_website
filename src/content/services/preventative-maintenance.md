## Data-Driven Preventative Maintenance

Reactive maintenance costs 3-5x more than planned upkeep. Ethyl Merc Group's Preventative Maintenance Programs use data-driven scheduling and predictive analysis to catch issues before they become failures, saving you money and minimising disruption to your operations.

### How Our PPM Program Works

We design custom maintenance schedules based on asset type, age, usage patterns, and manufacturer recommendations. Each program includes regular inspections, servicing, and condition reporting across all building trades—plumbing, electrical, HVAC, carpentry, and more.

### Our Maintenance Capabilities

- **Scheduled Inspections**: Monthly, quarterly, and annual inspection cycles tailored to your facility
- **Asset Management**: Digital asset registers, condition scoring, and replacement planning
- **Compliance Tracking**: Automated reminders for EWOF, BWOF, fire systems, and health & safety checks
- **Multi-Trade Coordination**: Single point of contact for all trades, reducing management overhead
- **Reporting**: Real-time dashboards, monthly reports, and annual asset health summaries

### The ROI of Prevention

Our clients typically see 25-40% reduction in total maintenance costs within the first 12 months of implementing a PPM program. Equipment lifespan extends by an average of 3-5 years, and unplanned callouts drop by over 60%.

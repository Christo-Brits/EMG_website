## When Every Second Counts

Unexpected failures don't wait for business hours. Ethyl Merc Group's Emergency Response division provides 24/7, 365-day coverage across New Zealand. Our rapid response teams are equipped to handle any critical facility failure—from burst pipes and electrical faults to structural damage and security breaches.

### How Our Emergency Response Works

One call to our emergency hotline triggers immediate dispatch of the nearest qualified technician. Our cloud-based dispatch system identifies the closest available tradesperson and provides real-time ETAs. Average response time across our network: under 2 hours.

### Emergency Capabilities

- **Water Emergencies**: Burst pipes, flooding, sewer overflows, and hot water failures
- **Electrical Emergencies**: Power outages, exposed wiring, sparking switchboards, and safety switch failures
- **Structural Emergencies**: Storm damage, fallen trees, roof leaks, and broken windows or doors
- **Security**: Broken locks, smashed glass, and temporary boarding
- **Make-Safe**: Temporary repairs to prevent further damage while permanent solutions are planned

### After the Emergency

Once the immediate issue is resolved, our team provides a detailed incident report including photos, cause analysis, and recommended permanent repairs. We coordinate directly with your insurance company and provide all required documentation for claims.

## Commercial Civil Works & Infrastructure

Ethyl Merc Group delivers comprehensive civil works solutions for commercial property owners, facility managers, and developers. From car park repairs to ground-up site preparation, our civil team brings the equipment, expertise, and project management capability to deliver on time and on budget.

### Built to Last

New Zealand's variable climate and seismic activity demand civil works built to exacting standards. Our civil engineers and site crews follow strict quality protocols, and all work is completed to the latest NZ Building Code and council requirements.

### Our Civil Capabilities

- **Concrete Works**: Slabs, footpaths, kerbing, vehicle crossings, and structural foundations
- **Earthworks**: Bulk excavation, site levelling, compaction, and sub-base preparation
- **Drainage**: Stormwater systems, soak pits, channel drains, and drainage remediation
- **Hardscaping**: Asphalt resurfacing, paving, retaining walls, and boundary fencing
- **Car Parks**: Full construction, line marking, wheel stops, and drainage systems

### Project Management Included

Every civil project is assigned a dedicated project manager who coordinates consents, traffic management, health and safety plans, and subcontractor scheduling. You get a single point of contact from start to finish.
